# Introduction

This project is dedicated to the WebAppDev class I am teaching for ACM in Spring 2012. Copyright is MIT, so feel free to use as is best.

Overall, this course will teach the fundamentals of web application design from the perspective of a solo creator with much ambition, but little to no previous knowledge or experience. Because of the plethora of possible topics, I limit the technologies to those which I have found to be easy to learn and implement on a standard computer (all of which are free and/or Open Source).

This course will be taught in two sections which will teach parallel concepts, but from two different perspectives:

### Traditional
The Traditional course is designed for those who are interested in learning the principles of web application design that can be applied immediately. The languages taught are those which are in heavy use and cause the least about of hassle to setup and use. Specifically:

* HTML
* CSS and CSS3
* Javascript
  * jQuery
* PHP
* MySQL

### Bleeding Edge
The Bleeding Edge course is for those who pick up languages and concepts with ease and who want to learn all of the latest and greatest technologies. This course will be taught in parallel with the Traditional course, but in addition to teaching many popular libraries in the various languages, Node.js will be taught instead of PHP. The difference is thus (partial list):

* HTML and HTML5
* CSS
  * SASS
* Javascript and advanced features
  * jQuery
  * Backbone
  * Sencha
* Node.js
  * Jade
  * Express
* MySQL
